The **Flowbroker-UI** is a Multi-Tenant UI for Dojot Flowbroker, a service based in NodeRed.
Initially, a flow is a sequence of functional blocks (nodes) to process incoming particular events or device messages. With a flow you can dynamically analyze each new message in order to apply validations, infer information, trigger actions or notifications.

## Overview

This code is based on Node-Red project, following your base schema. The original Node-RED consists of 6 node modules under the `@node-red` scope, which are pulled together by the top-level `node-red` module.

| Module                  | Description                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| node-red                | the main module that pulls together all of the internal modules and provides the executable version of Node-RED |
| @node-red/editor-api    | an Express application that serves the Node-RED editor and provides the Admin HTTP API                          |
| @node-red/runtime       | the core runtime of Node-RED                                                                                    |
| @node-red/util          | common utilities for the Node-RED runtime and editor modules                                                    |
| @node-red/registry      | the internal node registry                                                                                      |
| @node-red/nodes         | the default set of core nodes. This module only contains the Node-RED nodes - it does not expose any APIs.      |
| @node-red/editor-client | the client-side resources of the Node-RED editor application                                                    |

Due to the Dojot integration, the UI no longer offers the standard features provided by Node-RED:

- context
- config-nodes
- groups
- subflow
- import-library
- export-library

On the other hand, Flowbroker-UI now supports multi-tenant segregation, enabling multiple accounts to manage their flows independently.
Also it been blocked access to sensitive information from other tenants if user does not have permission.

## Dependencies

The Flowbroker-UI depends of the following Dojot services:

    - Auth
    - DeviceManager
    - DataBroker
    - Flowbroker
    - Flowbroker-context-manager
    - Kafka

## Roadmap

We propose some improvements to the Flowbroker-UI, aimed at improving the user experience and adding new features. Below are presented some issues to consider:

- Create translation for Portuguese;
- Creation of example for flows;
- Create unit tests for dojotStorageModule;
- Remove non-used scripts in Gruntfile;
- Remove no longer needed libraries from package.json;
- Rechecking license-exceptions.json;
- Also use the JWT Token (from local Storage) created by GUI-V2;

#### The current drawbacks

- If a new tenant is created, we should restart the service;

## Running the service

Before using the UI, you need to login through Dojot's GUI-V1.
After login, **Flowbroker UI** is available at the address "http:<dojot-adress>:<port>/nodered/<tenant-name>/".

### Configurations

Before running the **Flowbroker UI** service within your environment, make sure you configure the
environment variables to match your needs.

You can select the configuration file via the `FLOWBROKERUI_USER_CONFIG_FILE` variable. Its default value
is `production.conf`. Check the [config directory](./config) for the user configurations that are
available by default.

For more information about the usage of the configuration files and environment variables, check the
**ConfigManager** module in our [Microservice SDK](https://github.com/dojot/dojot-microservice-sdk-js).
You can also check the [ConfigManager environment variables documentation](https://github.com/dojot/dojot-microservice-sdk-js/blob/master/lib/configManager/README.md#environment-variables) for more details.

In short, all the parameters in the next sections are mapped to environment variables that begin
with `FLOWBROKERUI_`. You can either use environment variables or configuration files to change their values.
You can also create new parameters via environment variables by following the fore mentioned
convention.

#### General Configurations

| Key               | Purpose                                                             | Default Value | Valid Values             | Environment variable           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| server.host       | Server address                                                      | 0.0.0.0       | string                   | FLOWBROKERUI_SERVER_HOST       |
| server.port       | Sever Port                                                          | 2880          | integer                  | FLOWBROKERUI_SERVER_PORT       |
| log.console.level | Console logger level                                                | info          | info, debug, error, warn | FLOWBROKERUI_LOG_CONSOLE_LEVEL |
| log.file          | Enables logging on file (location: /var/log/flowui-logs-%DATE%.log) | false         | boolean                  | FLOWBROKERUI_LOG_FILE          |
| log.file.level    | Log level to log on files                                           | info          | string                   | FLOWBROKERUI_LOG_FILE_LEVEL    |
| log.verbose       | Whether to enable logger verbosity or not                           | false         | boolean                  | FLOWBROKERUI_LOG_VERBOSE       |

Besides that, you can also check the red-setting.js file in order to customize Node-RED configurations. All the variables are explained in https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/configuration#editor-configuration.

#### Frontend Configuration (Editor-UI)

You also should update the Front-end configuration with Dojot's account, applying in file @node-red/editor-client/src/js/dojot-config.js. After to update the configuration, you need rebuild the image.

| Key  | Purpose             | Default Value  | Valid Values |
| ---- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| host | URL to access Dojot | localhost:8000 | string       |

#### Generating Docker

Beforehand, you need an already running dojot instance in your machine. Check out the
[dojot documentation](https://dojotdocs.readthedocs.io)
for more information on installation methods.

Generate the Docker image:

```shell
docker build -f Dockerfile -t <username>/flowbroker-ui:<tag> .
```

Then an image tagged as `<username>/flowbroker-ui:<tag>` will be made available. You can send it to
your DockerHub registry to made it available for non-local dojot installations:

```shell
docker push <username>/flowbroker-ui:<tag>
```

**NOTE THAT** you can use the official image provided by dojot in its [DockerHub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/dojot/flowbroker-ui).

## Creating a new node

It's possible to create new nodes extending the flowbroker functionalities. The process consists of the following 2 steps:

1. At first, adding the new node in dojot's flowbroker service:

- There are two examples and a guide in the Flowbroker library, check the link for more details.
- https://github.com/dojot/flowbroker/tree/development/lib

2. Secondly, give it a visual representation in flowbroker-ui.

- Check the app/@node-red/nodes/core/node_example and app/@node-red/nodes/core/dojot/ to see some examples.
- Along with these two files, you also need to add the i18n information to locates/en-US/messages.json
